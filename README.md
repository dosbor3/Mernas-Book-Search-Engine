# Mernas-Book-Search-Engine

A Single Page Application (SPA) built using the MERN technologies stack.  This application built with REACT highlights my skillset using the REACT technology.  This app provides users with the ability to search Google's search engine to retrieve book titles and save the searched titles to their account after login.
